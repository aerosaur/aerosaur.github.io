bio: |
  I'm Michael Bowley, a cycling and sports photographer capturing the intensity,
  emotion, and athleticism of professional racing.

  I've worked with pro teams including Human Powered Health, L39ION of Los Angeles,
  Hustle Pro Cycling, Israel Premier Tech, Team USA, and Team Canada. On the brand
  side, I've collaborated with Rapha, Shimano, 3T, Paper Planes, Jakroo, and Elite.

  Whether it's the chaos of a sprint finish, the suffering on a mountain stage,
  or the quiet moments before a race, I aim to tell the story of cycling through
  images that capture what makes this sport extraordinary.
